### 🎯 What Was Removed

**Visual Elements:**
- 💵 Dollar sign icons
- 💰 Cost amounts next to activities
- 📊 Total cost statistics in Quick Stats
- 💳 Cost fields in all forms
- 🏷️ Cost badges on day cards

**Form Fields:**
- "Cost" input field in Add/Edit Activity modal
- "Total Cost" input field in Add/Edit Accommodation modal

**Statistics:**
- "Total Cost" card from trip overview
- Daily cost totals from day card headers
- Cost calculations from day statistics

### 📊 Remaining Statistics

The app now displays only these statistics:
- **Trip Duration**: Number of days
- **Activities**: Count of itinerary items
- **Accommodations**: Count of hotels/stays

### 🔍 Verification

**Build Status**: ✅ **SUCCESS**
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ Clean
- Vite build: ✅ Successful
- Bundle size: 623.82 kB (slightly smaller than before)

**Remaining Warnings**: 
- Only TypeScript `any` type warnings (non-breaking, cosmetic)

### 📱 User Impact

**What Users Will Notice:**
- Cost fields no longer appear in activity/accommodation forms
- No cost information displayed on activity cards
- Total cost statistic removed from trip overview
- Cleaner, simpler interface focused on planning rather than budgeting

**What Still Works:**
- All itinerary management features
- Drag and drop functionality
- All three view modes (Cards, Timeline, List)
- Cross-day dragging
- Activity editing and deletion
- Accommodation management

### 🗄️ Database Note

The `cost` field still exists in the database schema (`itinerary_items` table) but is:
- Not displayed in the UI
- Not included in forms
- Not sent when creating/updating items
- Existing cost data remains in database but is not shown

If you want to completely remove it from the database, you would need to run a migration:
```sql
ALTER TABLE itinerary_items DROP COLUMN cost;
```

### ✨ Benefits

- **Simplified UX**: Less cluttered interface
- **Faster data entry**: One fewer field to fill
- **Focus on planning**: Emphasis on itinerary rather than budget tracking
- **Cleaner design**: More space for important travel details
