## Feature Deep Dives

### Drag & Drop System

**Implementation**: `@dnd-kit/core` and `@dnd-kit/sortable`

**Trip Ideas ‚Üí Itinerary**:
1. Ideas panel uses `useDraggable` hook
2. Each idea card has drag handle with grip icon
3. Drag data includes: `{ type: 'idea', idea: TripIdea }`
4. Itinerary day cards are drop zones
5. On drop: `handleDragEnd` detects idea type
6. Converts idea to itinerary item with selected date
7. Removes idea from ideas list
8. Updates database

**Reordering Within Itinerary**:
1. Itinerary items use `useSortable` hook
2. Items within same day can be reordered
3. Items can be moved between days
4. Updates position and date in database

**Visual Feedback**:
- Dragging shows semi-transparent clone
- Drop zones highlight on hover
- Smooth animations during drag
- Clear grip handles indicating draggable items

### Photo Upload & EXIF Processing

**Upload Flow**:
1. User selects trip from dropdown
2. Drag files onto upload zone or click to browse
3. Files validated (image types only)
4. Preview thumbnails generated
5. EXIF data extracted using `exifr`:
   - GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude)
   - Date/time taken
   - Camera information
6. Files uploaded to Supabase Storage
7. Database record created with metadata
8. Thumbnails generated (Supabase handles)
9. Progress indicators update in real-time
10. Success confirmation shown

**EXIF Data Extraction**:
```typescript
import exifr from 'exifr'

const exifData = await exifr.parse(file)
const latitude = exifData.latitude
const longitude = exifData.longitude
const dateTaken = exifData.DateTimeOriginal
```

**Map Display**:
- Photos with GPS data shown as markers
- Leaflet.js for interactive maps
- Marker clustering for photos close together
- Click marker to see photos from that location

### Timeline/Gantt View Calculations

**Day Grid Generation**:
```typescript
const tripStartDate = new Date(trip.start_date)
const tripEndDate = new Date(trip.end_date)
const totalDays = Math.ceil(
  (tripEndDate.getTime() - tripStartDate.getTime()) 
  / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)
) + 1

const dates = Array.from({ length: totalDays }, (_, i) => {
  const date = new Date(tripStartDate)
  date.setDate(tripStartDate.getDate() + i)
  return date
})
```

**Activity Positioning**:
```typescript
// Calculate which day column the activity belongs to
const itemDate = new Date(item.start_datetime)
const dayIndex = Math.floor(
  (itemDate.getTime() - tripStartDate.getTime()) 
  / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)
)

// Calculate how many days it spans
const endDate = new Date(item.end_datetime)
const durationDays = Math.max(1, Math.ceil(
  (endDate.getTime() - itemDate.getTime()) 
  / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)
) + 1)

// Position with CSS Grid
gridColumnStart = dayIndex + 2 // +2 for category column
gridColumnEnd = span durationDays
```

## Security & Privacy

### Authentication

**Supabase Auth**:
- Email and password authentication
- Secure session management
- Password hashing (handled by Supabase)
- Protected routes check authentication state

**Protected Routes**:
```typescript
function ProtectedRoute({ children }) {
  const { user, loading } = useAuth()
  
  if (loading) return <LoadingSpinner />
  if (!user) return <Navigate to="/login" />
  
  return <>{children}</>
}
```

### Row Level Security (RLS)

**All tables have RLS enabled with policies:**

**Trips Table**:
```sql
-- Users can only view their own trips
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own trips"
  ON trips FOR SELECT
  USING (created_by = auth.uid())

-- Users can only insert trips for themselves
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own trips"
  ON trips FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (created_by = auth.uid())

-- Users can only update their own trips
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own trips"
  ON trips FOR UPDATE
  USING (created_by = auth.uid())

-- Users can only delete their own trips
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own trips"
  ON trips FOR DELETE
  USING (created_by = auth.uid())
```

**Itinerary Items Table**:
```sql
-- Users can view items for their trips
CREATE POLICY "Users can view itinerary items for their trips"
  ON itinerary_items FOR SELECT
  USING (
    trip_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM trips WHERE created_by = auth.uid()
    )
  )
-- Similar INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE policies
```

**Trip Ideas Table**:
```sql
-- Same pattern - can only access ideas for own trips
CREATE POLICY "Users can view trip ideas for their trips"
  ON trip_ideas FOR SELECT
  USING (
    trip_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM trips WHERE created_by = auth.uid()
    )
  )
```

**Photos Table**:
```sql
-- Users can only view their own photos
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own photos"
  ON trip_photos FOR SELECT
  USING (uploaded_by = auth.uid())
```

### Data Privacy

**User Isolation**:
- All data scoped to authenticated user
- No cross-user data access
- Database enforces isolation with RLS
- Frontend checks but backend is source of truth

**File Storage**:
- Photos stored in Supabase Storage
- Bucket policies match database RLS
- Secure URLs generated on request
- No public access to user photos

### Best Practices Implemented

‚úÖ **Input Validation**: TypeScript types + Zod schemas
‚úÖ **SQL Injection Prevention**: Supabase client uses parameterized queries
‚úÖ **XSS Prevention**: React escapes output by default
‚úÖ **CSRF Protection**: Supabase handles token management
‚úÖ **Secure Storage**: Supabase Auth stores tokens securely
‚úÖ **HTTPS**: All API calls over HTTPS (Supabase requirement)
