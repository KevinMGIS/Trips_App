# Debug Trip Ideas Not Saving

## Quick Debug Steps

Since you've already run the migration, let's find out what's happening:

### 1. Open Browser Console
- Press `F12` in your browser
- Go to the **Console** tab
- Try adding a trip idea
- **Copy any red error messages** you see

### 2. Check Network Tab
- Press `F12` in your browser
- Go to the **Network** tab
- Filter by "Fetch/XHR"
- Try adding a trip idea
- Look for a request to `trip_ideas`
- Click on it and check:
  - **Status code** (should be 201 or 200)
  - **Response** tab (look for error messages)
  - **Preview** tab (see the actual error)

### 3. Common Issues

**Issue 1: User not in correct trip**
The RLS policy checks if the trip belongs to the user who created it. Make sure you're:
- Logged in as the user who created the trip
- Adding ideas to YOUR trip (not someone else's)

**Issue 2: Priority field issue**
The priority field defaults to 'medium' but your form might be sending something else.

**Issue 3: Category validation**
The category must be one of: 'flight', 'accommodation', 'activity', 'restaurant', 'transport', 'other'
